\section*{Preface}
This section can contain facts about the report that does not
concern the technical content. For example, you can thank people.
You do not always need this section (remove this page in such
cases).

If you have been many people working together in the project, you
must, in this section, clarify how you have divided the work. Who
wrote what?
